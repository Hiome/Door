# SmarterPresence

Presence detector that uses a dual-technology approach to combine multiple sensor
types for a more accurate presence reading.

This code is written to run on an ESP8266 development board with an ultrasonic
sensor and PIR motion sensor. It assumes you have an MQTT broker on your network
to broadcast enter/exit events to.
